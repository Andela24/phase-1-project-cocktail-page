# 🚀  Description
I was able to develop my martini page using an open API that includes an object array.
 Martini drinks were a key component of the API I selected. As a first step, 
 you may go through a complete list of all the different types of martinis that are available, and then click on "search martinis,"
where you can type in the name of any cocktail you're interested in, There will be a photo of the martini you selected, 
as well as step-by-step directions on how to prepare it.
Enjoy!
